# Gesture Recognition Case Study
This case study aims at the automatic interpretation of gestures in order to offer new possibilities to interact with machine and to design more natural and more intuitive interactions with computing machines.

## Problem Statement:
* The company called Home Electronics which manufactures state of art televisions and the company wants to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using the remote.

* The gestures are continuously monitered by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

    1) Thumbs up : Increase the volume
    2) Thumbs down : Decrease the volumn
    3) Left swipe : Jump backwards 10 seconds
    4) Right swipe : Jump forward 10 seconds
    5) Stop : Pause the movie

## Objectives:
* We are required to build a gesture recognition model using neural network which should have generators that are able to take batches of data without error and with optimized number of parameters so that the inference or prediction time should be less.
* The architecture we are going to use is:
    1) 3D Convs
    2) CNN + RNN stacked
